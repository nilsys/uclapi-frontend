This can be used, for example, in apps and integrations which show users how busy each library is at given times of the day. You can show data based on the last day (e.g. yesterday), the last week or the last month. It is updated by us in the early hours of the morning (around 2am) so that users during the day have the latest data.

                        This endpoint will return a list with every survey requested, its ID, its name and average data for the period requested for every 10 minute period in a day. The  averages are not ordered, so it is recommended that the data is fed into some other code to transform the data in such as way as to ensure that it is user-friendly. One example might be a graphing library to plot the data throughout the day to produce an average occupancy graph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note that the counts below may not perfectly add up. This is because we perform an integer division calculation to get an average based on multiple days' worth of data, so you may encounter off-by-one errors if you check that `sensors_absent` + `sensors_occupied` == `sensors_total`. Please do not be alarmed by this! However, if you do get large, unexplained differences do let us know so that we can look into it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note further that there are some rare situations where the data source we use may have historical data missing. Sitautions that can cause this include new libraries being added which do not yet have historical data available, and situations where data has not properly been saved by our data provider. In cases like this, our response to your app will include an empty `averages` object with no times within it. Your code should account for this possibility by checking whether each time period is actually present. If time periods are missing your application should alert the user to data being missing and fail gracefully.
