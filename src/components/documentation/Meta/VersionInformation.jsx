          <p>Each service has a header named uclapi-servicenamehere-version which you can add to your requests, where servicenamehere is the endpoint name for the service you are using. For example, for the Room Bookings service you would set the uclapi-roombookings-version header.</p>

          <div className="warning">
            <b>Really Important Warning</b>
            <ul>
              <li>By default, every UCL API request gets sent to the latest version of the service you requested.</li>
              <li>This is okay for test purposes.</li>
              <li>If you are deploying into production you must follow the versioning instructions to ensure you are not affected by breaking changes.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>On the right hand side youâ€™ll see a code sample with the version data added. We are specifying that version 1 of the roombookings service should be used for the request URL <code>https://uclapi.com/roombookings/rooms?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb</code>. You should amend the example accordingly for the service and API version you are using.</p>
